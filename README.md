# Comutations
A Haskell accompaniment to Miklós Bóna's [Combinatorics of Permutations](https://www.crcpress.com/Combinatorics-of-Permutations-Second-Edition/Bona/p/book/9781439850510).

This repository contains the Haskell implementations of data structures and algorithms used in (or motivated by) the book, and the source for the associated GitHub pages blog (generated in [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/)).
